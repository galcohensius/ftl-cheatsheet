# FTL Cheatsheet

This is a fork of [hugomg's FTL Cheatsheet](https://github.com/hugomg/ftl-cheatsheet) with enhanced visual design, theme toggle, search functionality, and improved navigation.

The HTML inside the docs/ folder lists all the events in FTL Advanced Edition.

**Original version**: https://hugomg.github.io/ftl-cheatsheet/
